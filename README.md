# Image-Processing
Image Processing & Recognition - Exercises Part I-2 
This repository contains solutions to a series of image processing tasks using MATLAB. Below is a detailed explanation of the tasks and the corresponding code.

Task 1: Creating and Displaying a 3x2 RGB Matrix
In this task, we create a 3x2 matrix to represent pixel colors and display the resulting image. 

Task 2: Converting an RGB Image to Grayscale
In this task, we convert an RGB image to grayscale using two methods: arithmetic mean and weighted factors. 

Task 3: Calculating and Plotting Histograms
This task involves calculating and plotting the histogram of a grayscale image using both custom code and the imhist function. 

Task 4: Histogram Stretching
In this task, we perform histogram stretching to enhance the contrast of a grayscale image and compare the original and stretched histograms. 

Task 5: Histogram Equalization
In this task, we perform histogram equalization to improve the contrast of a grayscale image and compare the histograms before and after equalization.

Summary
This repository covers various image processing techniques including creating RGB images, converting images to grayscale using different methods, calculating and plotting histograms, performing histogram stretching, and histogram equalization. The tasks are implemented in MATLAB and the corresponding code snippets are provided for each task.
